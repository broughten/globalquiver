Hi <%=  @reservation.creator.first_name %>,

You just made a reservation on Global Quiver. Thanks! The details of your reservation are below, but here are a few important things you should know:
<% if @reservation.board.creator.is_a?(Surfer) %>
-- The owner of the board knows you reserved it but doesn't know who you are or how to get the board to you. You have to contact the owner at <%= @reservation.board.creator.email %> to figure out how to do the pickup and drop off.
<% if @reservation.board.daily_fee != 0.00 %>-- You should plan on paying for your board in cash in advance unless the owner of the board tell you otherwise.<% end %>
-- Please be cool. If you bust up a board and it's your fault, offer to pay for the repairs. The owner was doing you a favor to let you use it.
-- Be on time, don't flake and call the owner if there's an issue. This community depends on a little bit of being responsible.
<% else %>
-- Make sure you know the shop's hours so you don't show up to pick up the board while they are closed.
-- Please call or email the shop at <%= @reservation.board.creator.email %> to enquire about any steps needed to confirm your reservation.  You reservation may not be confirmed until you complete these steps with the shop.
-- Global Quiver doesn't manage or track surf shop rental policies. Be ready to pay a deposit, or pay in cash, or use a credit card, and in general do what the shop requires.
-- Please be cool. Don't flake on your reservations and call the shop if there's an issue. This community depends on a little bit of being responsible.
