Aggregate data are used for a number of purposes such as helping us understand trends and user needs so we can improve our products and services.</p>

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We also may use your information to ascertain favorable loan agreements for you, but will not enter you into any loan agreements without your express consent.</p>
<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways, such as when you visit the Site with your Internet browser or use the Service. In addition, GradeFund may ask you to provide certain personal information when filling out and submitting registration forms or providing feedback to GradeFund. When registering  for an account, you may be asked to provide your social security number, a bank account number, contact information, a student identification number, school and degree program information, your name and other personal information.

<p>When you use the Site, GradeFund may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate and evaluate your use of the Site and the Service.

The personal information that you provide online in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or of the Service or use the Service is protected in several ways.

<h4>Use of Cookies:</h4>
<p>In order to improve our Service and the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our vendors may use "cookies", "web beacons", and similar devices to track your activities. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables GradeFund to record your passwords, purchases and preferences. A web beacon is a small transparent "GIF" image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used by which a product, service or functionality may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur (such as after clicking a button on the Site or in an email). This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data. It is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an identification card and does not store any data on your computer. While GradeFund uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site and the Service, such as the number of downloads, types of Service used, and how many users we receive daily, and while our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, GradeFund does not generally use this information to identify you personally. However, if you expressly provide consent for the Site or the Service to "remember" you when you log into your account, that unique identifier will be stored on a cookie on your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Registration Information. As a result, your navigation path around the Site and the Service will be tracked.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies and similar devices. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or similar device, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it, though this may preclude you from using the Site.</p>
