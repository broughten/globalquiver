  <h2>
  1. USER RESPONSIBILITY
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">1.1 Our Site is a Venue.</span> Our Services do not include the introduction of
      users to one another nor users to surfshops, nor does it make any claims
      about surfboard quality, capability or safety, nore any claims whatsoever
      about the surf shops that participate as users of the site.
      Our Site is merely a venue for users to learn about
      one another and surfboards available to borrow or rent, and, if they wish,
      arrang to rent or borrow surfboards from one another and the shops that
      participate as users of the site. We are not involved in the actual contact
      between users. As a result, we have no control over the conduct of our users
      or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">1.2 Identity Verification.</span> Because user verification on the Internet is
      difficult, we cannot and do not confirm each user’s purported identity.
      You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others
      with whom you may contact by means of this Site. We do not endorse any
      persons or shops who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate
      any user’s or shop's reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or
      verify the information such user may submit to the Site. We encourage you to
      communicate directly with others who you may rent or loan surfboards to
      or rent or borrow surfboards from and through the tools available on the Site
      and to take the same precautions you would normally take when meeting a
      stranger in person for the first time.
    </li>

      be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other
      users of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor
      interactions between you and other users of our Services and to take any other

      filthy, violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.

      demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known
      and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of
      or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you
      waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend
      to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the
      time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
      settlement with the debtor."

    18. DISPUTES
  </h2>
  <p>
    In the event a dispute arises between you and us, our goal is to provide you with a neutral
    and cost-effective means to resolve the dispute quickly. Accordingly, any claim or controversy
    at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or our Services ("Claim") shall be resolved in
    accordance with one of the subsections below or as we may otherwise agree in writing. Before
    resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a
    resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative
    dispute resolution ("ADR") procedures, such as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">(a) Binding Arbitration.</span> For any Claim (excluding Claims for
      injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less
      than Ten Thousand US Dollars (US$10,000), you or we may elect to resolve the dispute through
      binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written
      submissions where no in-person appearance is required. In such cases, the arbitration shall
      be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable
      rules, or any other established ADR provider agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the
      award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">(b) Court.</span> Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a
      court of competent jurisdiction located in Colorado, USA or where the defendant is
      located (in our case Eagle County, Coloardo, USA, and in your case your home address).
      You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in
      Eagle County, Colorado or a US federal court located in Denver, Colorado.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution.</span> Alternatively, we will
      consider use of other forms of ADR, such as binding arbitration to be held in Colorado, USA
      or another location agreed upon by the parties.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="bold">(d) Attorney’s Fees.</span> All Claims (excluding requests for
      injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the
      dispute-resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section 17 by the
      first party to file a Claim. Should either party file an action contrary to this Section 17,
      the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to US$5,000, provided that the party
      seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim,
      and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.
