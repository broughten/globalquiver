  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p> GlobalQuiver, LLC. ("<strong>GlobalQuiver</strong>") provides this Privacy Policy to
    inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure
    of personal information we receive from users of
    <a href="http://www.Global Quiver.com">www.GlobalQuiver.com</a> (this "<b>Site</b>") and
    our Services (defined below).  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you
    provide to us through the Site and the Services.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from
    time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on the Site.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.
    Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have
    the same meanings as in our <a href="/pages/terms">Terms of Use </a>
  </p>
  <p> As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include
    using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis
    and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting,
    storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring
    information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or
    internationally.
  </p>
  <h2> Information Collection and Use  </h2>
  <p> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site,
    services, features and content, to administer your Account (as defined below) (together,
    the "<strong>Service</strong>") and to enable Visitors (defined below) to enjoy and easily
    navigate the Site.  </p>
  <h3> Personally Identifiable Information.   </h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you register with us or when you choose to add information to your profile
      we will ask you for personally identifiable information.  This refers to information
      about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("<strong>Personal
        Information</strong>").  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your
        name, email address, home address, mobile phone number and certain information,
        including login credentials, related to your social networks and other third party sites.
        We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your
        inquiries.
    </li>

    <li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and
      the administration and personalization of your profile page and Account (e.g., without
      limitation, zip code (on its own), your postings, location information, photos and
      individual preferences) ("<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>").
    </li>
    <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
      Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.
    </li>
    <li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal
      Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your
      zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
      But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when
      they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information
      (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine your Personal Information
      with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from
      others who use Global Quiver to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to
      improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our
      Site and Service are used.  We may also use the combined information without aggregating
      it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your
      preferences or restrictions.
    </li>
    <li>Any Personal Information or other content that you voluntarily disclose online (for example, on
      your public profile, in posts, comments, or notes) becomes publicly available and
      could be collected and used by others. Your account User Name, or your full name if
      you choose to provide it within your Account Settings, is displayed to other users
      when you post, send direct messages, or comment. Users may also search the Service and
      find your public profile which will include your User Name and any post made to everyone
      or comments that you submit to the Site may be redistributed through the Internet and
      other media, and could be viewed and/or used by the general public. In addition, if
      you chose to connect the Service to your other networks (including, but not limited to
      Facebook and Twitter), any information you post and your User Name through the Service
      will be shared with your other networks.
    </li>
    <li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you (via such means as SMS, email,
      etc.) with Global Quiver marketing or promotional materials, those "Alerts" or "Notifications"
      you elect to receive and other information that may be of interest to you (such as,
      when you have an upcoming board reservation).
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Log Data. </u>
    When you visit the Site or use the Services, whether as a registered Global Quiver
    user (a "<strong>User</strong>") or a non-registered visitor just browsing (any of
    these, a "<strong>Visitor</strong>"), our servers automatically record information that
    your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("<strong>Log Data</strong>").  This Log
    Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
    browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site or while you are
    using the Services, pages of our and third party sites that you visit, the time spent on
    those pages, information you search for on our Site or through the Services, access times
    and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the
    Site and the Service and for the Site and Services' technical administration, to increase
    the Site and Services' functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our
    Visitors' needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you
    visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the Services will serve information appropriate
    to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that Visitors and Users meet the
    criteria required to process their requests.  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information
    but we may use in association with other information and we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate
    such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying
    Information.
  </p>
  <h2> Cookies </h2>
  <p> Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.  A cookie is a small data
    file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies
    for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and
    login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable
    certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to
    monitor aggregate usage by Visitors and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent
    cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and
    Service and then close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or
    read cookies on your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options,
    to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
    visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of
    the Site or all functionality of the Service.
  </p>
  <h2> Phishing </h2>
  <p> Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to
    Global Quiver.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft
    is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,
    your Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or
    unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit
    the Federal Trade Commission's website.
  </p>
  <h2> Information Sharing and Disclosure   </h2>
  <p>
    <u>Registered Users.</u>
    When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile
    page, other Users will see your full name and email. You can choose what other Personal Information
    you provide as part of your profile, including but not limited to your location and
    information contained in your posts ("<strong>Other User Information</strong>").  Providing
    Other User Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction
    you want to have with other Users.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive
    information. We recognize that privacy is important and suggest that you
    consider what types of Other User Information you choose to share, including information about
    your location. Should you choose to disclose your information to "everyone" based on the
    settings in your post or profile, any location information that you choose to share will become
    public.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u>
    We may share aggregated information that includes Personal Information and we may otherwise
    disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis,
    demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Service Providers.</u>
    We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide
    the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation,
    maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features)
    or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.  These third parties have
    access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated
    not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to
    our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information
    on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of
    receiving such communications.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u>
    Global Quiver cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties
    to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government
    or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
    necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to
    subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Global Quiver or a third party, to protect
    the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be,
    or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Business Transfers.</u>
    Global Quiver may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your
    Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
    assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <h2> Changing or Deleting Your Information </h2>
  <p> All registered Users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their
    registration profile by accessing their Account Settings (Profile) page.  If you completely
    delete all such information, then your Account will become deactivated.  If you would like us
    to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your
    request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.  See below for privacy
    contact information.
  </p>
  <h2> Invitations  </h2>
  <p> Registered Users can invite friends to become registered users by sending invitation emails
    via our automated invitation system. We do not store the email addresses provided for these
    purposes.  Security  </p>
  <p> Global Quiver is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ administrative,
    physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized
    access.
  </p>
  <p> We will make any legally required disclosures of any  breach of the security, confidentiality,
    or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable
    state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on
    this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as
    consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary
    to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
  </p>
  <h2> International Transfer </h2>
  <p> Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of
    your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
    not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United
    States and choose to provide information to us, Global Quiver transfers Personal Information
    to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by
    your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
  </p>
  <h2> Links to Other Sites </h2>
  <p> Our Site, Service and the Application contain links to, and may allow you to visit, other
    websites ("<strong>Third Party Sites</strong>").  If you choose to visit any of these Third
    Party Sites by "clicking on" another third party link or navigating to a Third Party Site,
    you will be directed to that third party's website.  The fact that we link to a website or
    present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or
    representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their
    privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third
    party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
    computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites follow different
    rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
    We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
  </p>
  <h2> Our Policy Toward Minors </h2>
  <p> The Site and the Services are not directed to Users under 18. We do not knowingly collect
    personally identifiable information people under 18.   If a parent or guardian becomes aware
    that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent,
    he or she should contact us at info@globalquiver.com. If we become aware that a child under 18
    has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our
    files.
