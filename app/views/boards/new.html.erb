<h1>List a board for borrow or rent</h1>

<h3>When you enter one of your extra surfboards below, it will be added to your quiver.</h3>
<h3>If someone wants to borrow or rent it, we'll send you an email.</h3>
<h3>You will then need to reply with pickup and payment instructions.</h3>
<br>
<h2>First, where is this board?</h2>
<p>We need to know where your boar is so that people looking to take surf trips in your area will be able to find it, pick it up, and use it<p>
