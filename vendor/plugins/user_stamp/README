= UserStamp

Rails plugin that makes stamping records with a user when they are 
created and updated dirt simple. It assumes that your controller has 
a current_user method. It also assumes that any record being stamped
has two attributes--creator_id and updater_id. You can override both
of these assumptions easily.

== Setup

1. script/plugin install git://github.com/jnunemaker/user_stamp.git
2. Add user_stamp to application.rb, like the following:
		
		class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
		  user_stamp Post, Asset, Job
		end


== Defaults

  UserStamp.creator_attribute   = :creator_id
  UserStamp.updater_attribute   = :updater_id
  UserStamp.current_user_method = :current_user

If your user stamped columns and current_user method are different, 
just create an initializer such as config/initializers/user_stamp.rb
and copy and paste the defaults above, changing them to fit your app.
