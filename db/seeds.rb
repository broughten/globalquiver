# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
# This file should not create bogus test data, only data needed to make the application run.
# See the custom rake task in lib/tasks to populate test data.
# This is new to 2.3.4.
